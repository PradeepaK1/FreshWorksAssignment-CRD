This repository contains the CRD operations for creating, reading and deleting records with specific constraints
This is achieved in three ways
1. General kernel mode in Python IDLE :
Open your PYTHON IDLE and run the code.py file and type the function specific lines for execution (proper syntax required)
2. General file input output mode in Python IDLE or Command Prompt:
Open your PYTHON IDLE and run the code.py file and type the number modes and specific argument (no syntax required)
3. Python with Streamlit, a UI to the app:
Open Terminal from anaconda navigator's jupyter lab and type the commands
pip install streamlit
streamlit run code.py
and type the number modes and specific argument (no syntax required)

Here method 1 is completed for all three operations Create, Read, Delete

Method 2 and 3 is done partially for creating records and filing in JSON and TXT files seperately for later retrieval
